Air quality can be the amount of particulate matter, microscopic particles, in the air. Air quality could also be the measure of co2 in the atmosphere or, of nitrous oxide or a number of other factors. Breathing in air polluted in this way can be very dangerous at high levels, causing irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat or even cause further problems. These pollutants come from a number of sources, factories, refineries, and like establishments are commons sources of Co2 pollution. Another source of this type of pollution is combustion vehicles, which are also a culprit for particulate pollution. Particulates can also come from industrial/agricultural areas where lots of dust is released into the air. And while we are causing most of the problem, it is important to realize that natural causes can cause flares of bad or good air quality. For example, a wildfire will worsen the air quality significantly, while a strong wind will improve it. However, while these natural causes do have effect on the pollution of our skies, we are the source of almost all of that dangerous material and therefore it is our duty to remove it.",

While the city of Oakland didn’t want this to happen, the case eventually made its way to the Supreme court, where it was ultimately ruled as ok. Even after this, Phil has been under fire by the Oakland youth, with many protests surrounding his award show for environmental youth.
